				<h1>History of Kharagpur</h1>
				<p>
					Kharagpur received its name from the twelfth king of Mallabhum, Kharga Malla, when he
					conquered it. Kharagpur was a part of the Hijli Kingdom and ruled by Hindu Oriya 
					rulers as a feudatory under Gajapati Kings of Orissa. Historians claim that in the 16th
					century, Kharagpur was still a small village surrounded by dense forests. The village 
					was on high rocky barren land. The only inhabited settlement near Kharagpur was Hijli. 
					Hijli was a small island village on the banks of the Rasulpur River, in the delta of Bay
					of Bengal. It developed into a port town in 1687. Hijli was also a province and it existed
					until 1886. It covered parts of Bengal and Orissa.
